# Level02 Writeup

User level02 has a single `level02.pcap` file within his home directory. Opening the pcap file with wireshark shows comunication between two IPs. Analizing each packets data we see that at one point a machine sends a prompt for a login. Packet by packet we can see the response to the prompt and reconstruct the password `ft_waNDReL0L`, allowing us to log into the flag02 user and get the flag.
