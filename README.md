## What is this ?

Snow-crash is a ISO CyberSecurity 42 project. A ISO file is given with the login to the first level. Each level contains a vulnerable program or method for finding a flag, which is the password for the next level.

Level0 to level9 are mandatory to the project, level10 to level14 are bonus levels.

Each folder contains a writeup explaining how to solve the level and the level's flag.

**For your enjoyment, if you are a 42 student and you haven't completed this project, DO NOT READ THE SOLUTIONS!**
